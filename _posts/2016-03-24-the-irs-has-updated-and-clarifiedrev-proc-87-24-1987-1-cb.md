## IRS Clarifies and Updates Administrative Appeal Process for Docketed Cases

The IRS has updated and clarified Rev. Proc. 87-24 , 1987-1 CB 720, which describes the practice for the administrative appeals process in cases docketed in the Tax Court. The current guidance is the result of comments solicited in Notice 2015-72 , I.R.B. 2015-44, 613, and does not materially change the procedures proposed in that Notice.

Under the modifications, IRS Counsel will generally refer cases docketed in Tax Court to Appeals for settlement consideration unless a notice of deficiency is issued or the taxpayer wants to forgo settlement consideration. IRS Counsel, however, will not refer any docketed case or issue that has been designated for litigation or any case docketed under certain specific Code Sections. The guidance also clarifies procedures to be followed if IRS Council needs additional time before referring a case, the taxpayer raises new issues while the case in the appeal process, and internal procedures for handling and transferring custody of the administrative file for docketed cases referred to Appeals. Rev. Proc. 87-24, 1987-1 CB 720, is clarified.
